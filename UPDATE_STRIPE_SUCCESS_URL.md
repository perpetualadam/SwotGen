# 🔗 UPDATE STRIPE SUCCESS URL - CORRECT DOMAIN

**Status**: Action Required  
**Time**: 3 minutes  
**Importance**: Critical

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT

The Stripe payment link Success URL needs to be updated to use the correct domain:

### **Old (Incorrect):**
```
https://swotgen.vercel.app/payment-success
```

### **New (Correct):**
```
https://swot-gen.vercel.app/payment-success
```

---

## 🎯 WHY THIS MATTERS

The Success URL tells Stripe where to redirect after successful payment. If it's pointing to the wrong domain, the payment verification won't work.
