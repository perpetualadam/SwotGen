## ðŸ“‹ QUESTION 1: PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION

### âœ… Is the export feature code already deployed to Vercel?

**Answer**: âœ… **YES - ALREADY DEPLOYED**

The export feature was deployed to Vercel in commit `87cba60` (feat: Add PDF export functionality).

**What's Deployed**:
```
âœ… components/ExportButton.js - PDF generation component
âœ… pages/index.js - Export button integration
âœ… package.json - jsPDF and html2canvas dependencies
âœ… package-lock.json - Locked dependency versions
```

1. Commit `87cba60` pushed to GitHub
2. Vercel detected the commit
3. Vercel automatically rebuilt the app
4. Vercel automatically deployed the changes
5. Export feature now live on Vercel

### âœ… Will the export button appear for premium users on Vercel?

**Answer**: âœ… **YES - AUTOMATICALLY**

The export button will appear for premium users because:

**How It Works**:
```javascript
// pages/index.js line 146
{(isPremium || DEV_MODE_SHOW_EXPORT) && (
  // Export button visible
)}
```

**On Vercel (Production)**:
```
NODE_ENV = 'production'
DEV_MODE_SHOW_EXPORT = false
isPremium = true (after payment)
Result: Export button VISIBLE âœ…
```

**On Local (Development)**:
```
NODE_ENV = 'development'
DEV_MODE_SHOW_EXPORT = true
isPremium = false (no payment)
Result: Export button VISIBLE âœ… (for testing)
```
