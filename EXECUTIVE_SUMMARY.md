## 🔐 SECURITY VERIFIED

### Dev Mode
- ✅ Only works locally (NODE_ENV = 'development')
- ✅ Automatically disabled on Vercel
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities

### Production
- ✅ Premium-only restriction active
- ✅ No code changes needed for deployment
- ✅ Safe to deploy as-is

---

## 📝 KEY INFORMATION

### Dev Mode Configuration
```javascript
// pages/index.js line 16
const DEV_MODE_SHOW_EXPORT = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && true;
```

### How It Works
- **Local**: Export button visible (dev mode)
- **Vercel**: Export button hidden (premium-only)
- **Automatic**: No manual changes needed

### Why It's Safe
- Dev mode only works when running `npm run dev`
- Vercel automatically sets NODE_ENV = 'production'
- Premium-only restriction remains active on production
