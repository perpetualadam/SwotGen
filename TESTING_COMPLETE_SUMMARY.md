## 🔐 DEV MODE SECURITY

### How It Works
```javascript
// Local development (NODE_ENV = 'development')
const DEV_MODE_SHOW_EXPORT = true;
// Export button visible ✅

// Vercel production (NODE_ENV = 'production')
const DEV_MODE_SHOW_EXPORT = false;
// Export button hidden (premium-only) ✅
```

### Why It's Safe
- ✅ Dev mode only works when `NODE_ENV === 'development'`
- ✅ Vercel automatically sets `NODE_ENV = 'production'`
- ✅ No manual changes needed for production
- ✅ Premium-only restriction remains active on Vercel
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities

---

## 📝 IMPORTANT NOTES

### Dev Mode is Local Only
- ✅ Only works when running `npm run dev`
- ✅ Automatically disabled on Vercel
- ✅ No code changes needed for production

### Production Behavior
- ✅ Export button only for premium users on Vercel
- ✅ This is correct and intended
- ✅ Users must upgrade to see export button

### Next Steps After Testing
1. Verify all tests pass locally
2. Set up Stripe payment environment variables
3. Test premium payment flow on Vercel
4. Verify export button appears after payment
5. Final production verification

---

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Export button not visible?
1. Make sure you analyzed an idea
2. Restart dev server: Ctrl+C, then `npm run dev`
3. Refresh browser: F5
