---

## 🚀 QUICK START (15 Minutes)

### Step 1: Create Stripe Payment Link (5 min)
1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com
2. Click **"Payment Links"** in left sidebar
3. Click **"Create"** button
4. Configure:
   - **Product name**: "Premium Subscription"
   - **Price**: $9.99
   - **Billing period**: One-time
5. Click **"Create link"**
6. **Copy the URL** (looks like: `https://buy.stripe.com/test_abc123...`)

### Step 2: Add to `.env.local` (2 min)
Create or edit `.env.local` in your project root:

```env
TOGETHER_API_KEY=your_together_api_key_here

NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK=https://buy.stripe.com/test_abc123...
```

**Replace** the URL with your actual payment link.

### Step 3: Test It (8 min)
1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Click **"Upgrade"** button (top right)
3. Click **"Upgrade Now"** in modal
4. Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
5. Any future date and any CVC
6. Complete payment
7. Verify premium status updates
8. Refresh page - premium status persists ✅

## 📋 How It Works

### User Flow
```
User clicks "Upgrade" button
    ↓
Premium modal appears with features & price
    ↓
User clicks "Upgrade Now"
    ↓
Stripe Payment Link opens in new window
    ↓
User completes payment (test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242)
    ↓
User closes payment window
    ↓
App detects window closed
    ↓
Premium status activated ✅
    ↓
Status saved to localStorage
    ↓
Premium features unlocked
```

### Premium Status Persistence
Your premium status is saved in **two ways**:

1. **localStorage** - Survives page refresh
   - Automatically saved when payment succeeds
   - Automatically loaded when page loads
   - Cleared when user downgrades

2. **URL parameter** - For redirect after payment
   - If URL has `?premium=true`, status is activated
   - Useful if Stripe redirects back to your app

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variable
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK=https://buy.stripe.com/test_abc123...
```

**Why `NEXT_PUBLIC_`?**
- Makes variable accessible from browser
- Needed to open payment link from frontend
- Safe because it's just a URL, not a secret

### Payment Link URL Format
```
https://buy.stripe.com/test_abc123...
```

- **test_** = Test mode (for development)
- **live_** = Live mode (for production)
- **abc123...** = Your unique payment link ID

---

## 🔐 Security

### What's Secure ✅
- ✅ Payment link is public (safe to expose)
- ✅ No sensitive data in frontend
- ✅ Stripe handles all payment processing
- ✅ No credit card data stored in your app
- ✅ HTTPS required for production

### What's Not Secure (Yet) ⚠️
- ⚠️ localStorage can be cleared by user
- ⚠️ No server-side verification
- ⚠️ User could manually set premium status in browser console

### For Production
1. **Add webhooks** - Verify payment on server
2. **Add database** - Store premium status permanently
3. **Use Supabase** - Simple database solution
4. **Verify on server** - Check payment before allowing premium features

---

## 🚀 Deployment

### To Production
1. Create **live** payment link in Stripe Dashboard
2. Update `.env.local` with live payment link URL
3. Deploy to Vercel/production
4. Test with real payment (optional)

### Environment Variables
```env
# Development (test mode)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK=https://buy.stripe.com/test_abc123...

# Production (live mode)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK=https://buy.stripe.com/live_abc123...
```
