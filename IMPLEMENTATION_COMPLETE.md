## 🚀 QUICK START (15 Minutes)

### Step 1: Create Stripe Payment Link (5 min)
```
1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com
2. Click "Payment Links" in left sidebar
3. Click "Create" button
4. Set up:
   - Product name: "Premium Subscription"
   - Price: $9.99
   - Billing period: One-time
5. Click "Create link"
6. Copy the URL (looks like: https://buy.stripe.com/test_abc123...)
```

### Step 2: Add to `.env.local` (2 min)
```env
TOGETHER_API_KEY=your_together_api_key_here

NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK=https://buy.stripe.com/test_abc123...
```

**Replace** the URL with your actual payment link.

### Step 3: Test It (8 min)
```
1. Run: npm run dev
2. Click "Upgrade" button (top right)
3. Click "Upgrade Now" in modal
4. Use test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
5. Any future date and any CVC
6. Complete payment
7. Verify premium status updates
8. Refresh page - status persists ✅
```

## 📋 How It Works

### User Flow
```
User clicks "Upgrade" button
    ↓
Premium modal appears with features & price
    ↓
User clicks "Upgrade Now"
    ↓
Stripe Payment Link opens in new window
    ↓
User completes payment
    ↓
User closes payment window
    ↓
App detects window closed
    ↓
Premium status activated ✅
    ↓
Status saved to localStorage
    ↓
Premium features unlocked
```

### Premium Status Persistence
- **localStorage** - Survives page refresh
- **URL parameter** - For redirect after payment
- **Automatic loading** - On page mount

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variable
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK=https://buy.stripe.com/test_abc123...
```

**Why `NEXT_PUBLIC_`?**
- Makes variable accessible from browser
- Needed to open payment link from frontend
- Safe because it's just a URL, not a secret

### Payment Link URL Format
```
https://buy.stripe.com/test_abc123...
```
- `test_` = Test mode (development)
- `live_` = Live mode (production)

---

## 🔐 Security

### What's Secure ✅
- ✅ Payment link is public (safe to expose)
- ✅ No sensitive data in frontend
- ✅ Stripe handles all payment processing
- ✅ No credit card data stored in your app

### What's Not Secure (Yet) ⚠️
- ⚠️ localStorage can be cleared by user
- ⚠️ No server-side verification
- ⚠️ User could manually set premium status

### For Production
1. Add webhooks to verify payment on server
2. Add database (Supabase) to store premium status
3. Verify payment before allowing premium features

---

## 🚀 Deployment

### To Production
1. Create **live** payment link in Stripe Dashboard
2. Update `.env.local` with live payment link URL
3. Deploy to Vercel/production
4. Test with real payment (optional)

### Environment Variables
```env
# Development (test mode)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK=https://buy.stripe.com/test_abc123...

# Production (live mode)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK=https://buy.stripe.com/live_abc123...
```
