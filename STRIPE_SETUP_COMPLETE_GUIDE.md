## üéØ STEP 1: CREATE STRIPE PAYMENT LINK

### What is a Payment Link?

A Stripe Payment Link is a simple URL that customers click to pay. It's the easiest way to accept payments without building a custom checkout.

### How to Create It

**Step 1.1**: Go to Stripe Dashboard
```
1. Open: https://dashboard.stripe.com
2. Log in with your Stripe account
3. Make sure you're in "Test Mode" (toggle in top right)
```

**Step 1.2**: Create Payment Link
```
1. Click: "Payment Links" in left sidebar
2. Click: "+ New" button
3. Fill in the form:
   - Product name: "SwotGen Premium"
   - Description: "Unlimited SWOT analyses + PDF export"
   - Price: 9.99
   - Currency: GBP (¬£)
   - Quantity: Fixed (1)
4. Click: "Create link"
```

**Step 1.3**: Configure Payment Link
```
1. After link is created, you'll see the URL
2. Copy the URL (looks like: https://buy.stripe.com/test/...)
3. Save this URL - you'll need it in Step 2
```

**Step 1.4**: Set Success URL (Optional but Recommended)
```
1. In Payment Link settings, scroll to "After payment"
2. Set "Success URL" to: https://swotgen.vercel.app?premium=true
3. This redirects users back to your app after payment
4. Save changes
```

## üéØ STEP 2: ADD PAYMENT LINK TO VERCEL

### Configure Environment Variable

**Step 2.1**: Go to Vercel Dashboard
```

2. Log in with your account
3. Click on your "swotgen" project
```

**Step 2.2**: Add Environment Variable
```
1. Click: "Settings" tab
2. Click: "Environment Variables" in left sidebar
3. Click: "Add New" button
4. Fill in:
   - Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK
   - Value: [Your Stripe Payment Link URL]
   - Environments: Select "Production", "Preview", "Development"
5. Click: "Save"
```

**Step 2.3**: Redeploy Your App
```
1. Go to: "Deployments" tab
2. Find the latest deployment
3. Click: "..." menu
4. Click: "Redeploy"
5. Wait for deployment to complete (2-3 minutes)
```

## üéØ STEP 3: TEST PAYMENT FLOW LOCALLY

### Test Before Going Live

**Step 3.1**: Add Payment Link to Local Environment
```
1. Create/edit .env.local file
2. Add: NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK=[Your Stripe Payment Link URL]
3. Save file
4. Restart dev server: Ctrl+C, then npm run dev
```

**Step 3.2**: Test Payment Flow Locally
```
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000
2. Analyze an idea
3. Click: "Upgrade" button
4. Stripe payment modal should open
5. Use Stripe test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
6. Expiry: Any future date (e.g., 12/25)
7. CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., 123)
8. Complete payment
9. You should be redirected back to app
10. Export button should appear
11. Try exporting a PDF
```

**Test Card Details**:
```
Card Number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
Expiry: 12/25 (or any future date)
