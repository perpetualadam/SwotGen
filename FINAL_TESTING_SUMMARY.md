## 📝 WHAT WAS CHANGED

### Code Modifications
```
File: pages/index.js
- Line 16: Added dev mode flag
- Line 145-157: Updated export button visibility
- Total: 12 lines changed
```

### Dev Mode Logic
```javascript
// Line 16: Define dev mode
const DEV_MODE_SHOW_EXPORT = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && true;

// Line 145: Show export button if premium OR dev mode
{(isPremium || DEV_MODE_SHOW_EXPORT) && (
  // Export button visible
)}

// Line 149: Show appropriate label
{DEV_MODE_SHOW_EXPORT && !isPremium ? '🧪 Dev Mode - Export Test' : 'Premium Feature'}
```

### Why This Works
```
Local (npm run dev):
- NODE_ENV = 'development'
- DEV_MODE_SHOW_EXPORT = true
- Export button visible ✅

Vercel (production):
- NODE_ENV = 'production'
- DEV_MODE_SHOW_EXPORT = false
- Export button hidden (premium-only) ✅
```
