**Status**: Ready to configure  
**Time**: 3 minutes  
**Importance**: Critical for payment verification

## ⚠️ WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT

This is the fix for the bug we discovered earlier where failed payments were granting premium access.

**The Problem We Fixed:**
- User closes payment window without completing payment
- App incorrectly grants premium access
- User gets premium features for free

**The Solution:**
- Configure Success URL in Stripe
- Only successful payments redirect to success page
- Only successful payments grant premium access

## 🎯 WHAT YOU'LL DO

You'll configure your Stripe payment link to redirect to our success page after successful payment. This enables proper payment verification.
