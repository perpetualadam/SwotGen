## 🎨 **PADDING DETAILS**

**Tailwind Padding Values:**
- `pl-8` = `padding-left: 2rem` (32px)
- `pl-10` = `padding-left: 2.5rem` (40px)
- `pl-12` = `padding-left: 3rem` (48px) ✨ **NEW**

**Padding Progression:**
- `pl-8` → `pl-10`: +8px (initial alignment)
- `pl-10` → `pl-12`: +8px (fine-tuning for pixel-perfect alignment)
- **Total increase from pl-8:** +16px

**Why `pl-12`?**
- Accounts for emoji width (🎯) + space + fine-tuning
- Aligns "A" of "AI-powered" with "A" of "AnalysisGen"
- Pixel-perfect character-level alignment
- Professional appearance
- Better visual hierarchy

---

## ✅ **REQUIREMENTS MET**

- ✅ "A" of "AI-powered" aligns with "A" of "AnalysisGen"
- ✅ Pixel-perfect character-level alignment
- ✅ Approximately 2 space characters additional padding
- ✅ Better visual hierarchy
- ✅ Professional appearance
- ✅ Uses Tailwind CSS (`pl-12`)
- ✅ Maintains existing styling
- ✅ Responsive design preserved

---

## 📝 **ALIGNMENT EXPLANATION**

**Pixel-Perfect Character Alignment:**
- The emoji (🎯) is decorative
- The main title starts with "A" in "AnalysisGen"
- The subtitle now starts with "A" in "AI-powered"
- Both "A"s are vertically aligned at the pixel level
- Creates perfect visual symmetry
- Professional and polished appearance

**Space Character Equivalence:**
- Monospace font: 1 space ≈ 8-10px
- 2 spaces ≈ 16-20px
- `pl-10` to `pl-12` = +8px (approximately 1 space)
- Additional fine-tuning for perfect alignment
